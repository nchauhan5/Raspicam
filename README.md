# Raspicam
Efficient Embedded Driver Software on Raspberry Pi Webcam for edge detection

Worked on improving the performance (Frames per second) of sequential Canny edge algorithm for edge detection in a pgm extension of image by implementing multithreading using OpenMP and pThreads in its C++ code. Used Raspicam library to capture images in real time.

Tech Stack - C++, C, Linux kernel (Raspbian OS), Raspicam driver files in C
